# Data Visualization Project

Creating visualization using **matplotlib** and **pygal** packages

### 1. The most starred Python projects on GitHub (üìÅ[*python_repos*](https://github.com/mileevamaria/data-visualization/tree/master/python_repos))

Interactive bar chart, built by using information from the API call:
- the height of each bar represents the number of stars the project has acquired
- houvering the coursor over an individual bar shows the information that the project represents
- clicking a bar will take you to the project's home on GitHub

### 2. The world's population in 2010 (üìÅ[*worldmap*](https://github.com/mileevamaria/data-visualization/tree/master/worldmap))

Interactive map chart that shows population of each country:
- global data downloaded from Open Knowledge Foundation and extracted from JSON format
- three-letter codes of each country from data were adapted to two-letter code which Pygal's mapping tool expected
- countries were grouped into three population levels

### 3. Plotting the Random Walk (üìÅ[*random_walk*](https://github.com/mileevamaria/data-visualization/tree/master/random_walk))

Generating data for a random walk and plotting it:
- creating `class RandomWalk()` which makes random decisions about which direction the walk should take
- visualizing random walks using `scatter`, coloring and styling the plot
